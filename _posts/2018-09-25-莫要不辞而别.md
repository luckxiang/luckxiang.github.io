--泰戈尔     

人生难得相遇,莫要不辞而别.

> Do not go， my love， without asking my leave.

> I have watched all night， and now my eyes are heavy with sleep.

> I fear lest I lose you when I am sleeping.

> Do not go， my love， without asking my leave.

> I start up and stretch my hands to touch you. I ask myself， "Is it a dream？"

> Could I but entangle your feet with my heart and hold them fast to my breast！

> Do not go， my love， without asking my leave.
